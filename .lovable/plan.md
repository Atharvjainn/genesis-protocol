# Hackathon Kickoff Experience

A cinematic, terminal-controlled hackathon timer with a three-phase story-driven animation sequence that fuses cosmic particles, code compilation, and circuit awakening into one unforgettable experience.

## 🎬 Experience Flow

### Phase 1: Terminal Landing
- Full-screen dark terminal interface with monospace typography
- Blinking cursor and "Type 'start' to begin the hackathon" prompt
- Typing effect with authentic terminal feel
- Input validation that only accepts "start" command

### Phase 2: Dramatic Countdown (1 → 2 → 3)
- Massive centered numbers with screen shake effect
- Glitch distortion and light blur on each number
- Gradient background pulses in sync with impacts
- ~800ms per number with smooth transitions

### Phase 3: Three-Stage Cinematic Animation (~7 seconds)

**Stage A - Cosmic Energy Ignition:**
- Thin glowing line appears and fractures into hundreds of particles
- Particles explode outward then orbit like galaxies
- Deep blues, purples, and cyan highlights
- Motion blur and parallax depth effects

**Stage B - Code Compilation:**
- Particles transform into falling code characters
- Digital rain that snaps into geometric patterns
- Brief glitch flickers, then stabilization
- Colors shift to neon green and electric cyan

**Stage C - Circuit Awakening:**
- Code geometry morphs into circuit/neural patterns
- Energy pulses travel through branching pathways
- All energy converges toward center
- Rhythmic glow suggesting a heartbeat

**Resolution:**
- Energy collapses into radiant core
- Core expands and reveals the timer UI

### Phase 4: Active Timer
- Large digital display showing 24:00:00
- "Hackathon Time Remaining" header
- Breathing glow and pulsing progress ring
- Subtle animated background to show time is active
- localStorage persistence for refresh-proof timing

## ✨ Visual Design

- **Color Palette:** Deep blacks, dark blues, neon cyan, purple, and green accents
- **Typography:** Monospace for terminal, bold display font for timer
- **Effects:** Glow/bloom, motion blur, screen shake, glitch distortion
- **Theme Customization:** Ability to switch accent colors (cyan/purple/green)
